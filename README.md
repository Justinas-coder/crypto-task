### Application can manage your your crypto assets and see values.

- You can create two entities in this Web Application: User and Asset:
- User can CRUD his Assets.

### Asset:
- Has label e.g 'binance'.
- Currencies available: BTC, ETH, IOTA .
- Value cannot be negative.
- Application can have the same currency multiple times. e.g (1BTC 'usb stick', 1BTC 'binance'). Get the
  value of his Assets in USD (both total and separately).
- Application get exchange rate from external API.


### Stack:

- Docker
- Laravel 9x
- Bootstrap
- Postman



### How to launch it:

1. Deppending on your OS (win, Ubuntu, Mac) make your system ready to use (https://www.docker.com).

2. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Justinas-coder/crypto-task
```
3. Install PHP dependencies (reference: https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail#installing-composer-dependencies-for-existing-projects)
```
docker run --rm \
-u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
-v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
-w /var/www/html \
laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```
4. Create .env file
```
   cp .env.example .env
```

5. Start containers
```
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```

6. Generate app encryption key
```
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
```

7. Make migrations using CML command as bellow:

```
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
```
8. Seed database using CML command.
```
./vendor/bin/sail artisan db:seed
```
9. Application use external API https://coinlayer.com/ data, so you need to get you API KEY and create
   fill in .env variable, as bellow:
```
COIN_LAYER_API_KEY="YOUR KEY = Your Key."
```
10. You can now access the server at http://localhost/login.
    For testing purpose you can create User by "Register" button, and fulfilling login form,
    or using CML command, using Tinker:

```
php artisan tinker
```
```
User::factory()->create()
```
```
$user = User::first();

```
email for login will be generated by Faker,
password will be  "password".

### As HTTP API application returns JSON format.

POST /api/assets HTTP/1.1 \
Host: localhost\
Accept: application/json\
Authorization: Bearer 4|WYXNJ7vStXHfSqGUvCgJJWyls4HA5nGKhHApWtSu\
Content-Type: application/json\
Content-Length: 128\

{\
"title": "TestingPOST",\
"crypto_currency": "BTC",\
"quantity": "2",\
"paid_value": "32",\
"currency": "USD"\
}

For API testing plainTextToken need to be generated using Tinker. In CML put commands as bellow:

```
php artisan tinker
```
```
$user = User::first();
```
```
$user->createToken('developer-access');
```

and now PlainTextToken was generates. as e.g. bellow:

     +plainTextToken: "1|pceV0SXIpglwt5y3sQF167jsqBczJ51dXpsmla8A",

#### URL GET method:
```
http://localhost/api/assets/{id}
```  
returns single asset by id with values in JSON data format as e.g. :\

"asset": {\
"id": 3,\
"user_id": 1,\
"title": "Testing Jason 3",\
"crypto_currency": "BTC",\
"quantity": "2",\
"paid_value": "32",\
"currency": "USD",\
"created_at": "2022-08-24T13:12:32.000000Z",\
"updated_at": "2022-08-26T07:23:54.000000Z"\
}

#### URL GET method:
```
http://localhost/api/assets
```  
returns all created asset with values in JSON data format as e.g. :

- "asset": {\
"id": 3,\
"user_id": 1,\
"title": "Testing Jason 3",\
"crypto_currency": "BTC",\
"quantity": "2",\
"paid_value": "32",\
"currency": "USD",\
"created_at": "2022-08-24T13:12:32.000000Z",\
"updated_at": "2022-08-26T07:23:54.000000Z"\
}

#### URL GET method:
```
http://localhost/api/assets/total
```
returns total values of each currency,
value is calculated with live data from external API. e.g :

- {
"currency": "BTC",
"current_value": 2089086.5048939998
},
- {
  "currency": "ETH",
  "current_value": 8069.964915
  },
- {
  "currency": "MIOTA",
  "current_value": 1.46922
  }


#### For asset "store"  use HTTP POST method with URL :

```
http://localhost/api/assets
```

API receives request with JSON data as bellow e.g.

- {\
"title": "Testing Jason POST",\
"crypto_currency": "BTC",\
"quantity": "2",\
"paid_value": "32",\
"currency": "USD"\
}

#### For asset "delete"  use HTTP DELETE method with URL :

```
http://localhost/api/assets/{id}
```

- Delete asset by "id" number.

#### For asset "update"  use HTTP PUT method with URL :

```
http://localhost/api/assets/{id}
``` 

End point of this URL is Asset id number.

API receives JSON data as bellow e.g.

{\
"title": "Testing Jason 5",\
"crypto_currency": "BTC",\
"quantity": "2",\
"paid_value": "32",\
"currency": "USD"\
}


#### Run PHP Unitest for Asset store and DB check for Web and Api applications with CML command
```
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test
```
